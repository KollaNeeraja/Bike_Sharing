# Bike_Sharing System
> A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario.
It has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.

## Bussiness Objective:
BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.

They wanted to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market.

# Exploratory Data Analysis & Model Steps

## Steps
# EDA
 ## . Data cleaning and Missing data anlysis
 ## . outlier Analysis & Tretament Assumptions  values
 ## . Deriving Categorical Columns

# Model Preperation
  ## . Training and Test data Split
  ## . Feature scaling - standarad scaler
  ## . feature Engineering and selection using RFE and variance inflation factor

  ## . Model Evaluation & Assessment
  ## . Prediction
  ## . Final conclusion and anlaysis

# Conclusion:

## EDA Analysis:
 ## Hence we can conclude the final model
## . The company should focus on the follwing features.  . Company should focus on bussines when hum and windspeed are high by providing safety 
## . Based on data it expected to have a boom in  number of users once situation comes back to normal.
## . There would be less bookings during weathersit_Mist_cloudy, they could probably use this time to serive the bikes without having business impact.
## . Hence when the situation comes back to normal, the company should come up with new offers during spring when the weather is pleasant and also advertise a little for September as this is when business would be at its best.

## .  When tempearture is good there are high no of rental bikes
## . Hum and windspeed is high count is less
## . sat and has high sales of bike rental
## . temp has high correlation and taking bike rental demand is going high are good at that time
## . spring , mnth _nov and mnth_dec has there are less demand
## . mnth_sep, season winter has bit demand of bikes


 # Significant variables to predict the demand for shared bikes
